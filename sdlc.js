// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation ( i know in the slides this actually step 4 but Nithin mentioned this one more often comes after testing)
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, this is when you analyize and determine what requirements are asked for in the project. This is when a plan is created."
const design = "The thrid step, this is when the project is created and programmed."
const testingAndImplementation = "Step four. Testing the code to make sure it all works and implementing the features."
const implementation = "Step five. When the project is launced to the user base."
const maintain = "Step six. This is is the final step where the project has been launced and now their is just consistent maintence to work out any missed bugs"
